## Arch Linux

#### Using AUR (Recommended)

The simplest way to install Noctalia on Arch Linux is through the Arch User Repository (AUR). This method installs the shell system-wide and handles dependencies automatically.

Please replace with your AUR helper of choice.

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell
```

#### Development Version

For the latest features and fixes, you can install the development version directly from the Git repository:

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell-git
```

:::caution
The development version may be less stable than the official release. Use this version if you want to test the latest features or contribute to development.
:::

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install Noctalia locally or want more control over the installation process, you can install it manually to your user configuration directory.

**Step 1**: Install Quickshell dependency
```bash
paru -S quickshell-git
```

**Step 2**: Download and install Noctalia
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell && \
curl -sL https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/releases/latest/download/noctalia-latest.tar.gz | \
tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell
```

:::tip
Manual installation keeps Noctalia contained within your user directory, making it easy to remove or update without affecting system packages.
:::

## NixOS

#### Quick Run

Test Noctalia without installing by running it directly:

```bash
nix run github:noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell
```

#### Permanent Installation

For a permanent installation on NixOS, you'll need to add Noctalia to your system configuration.

**Step 1**: Update your `flake.nix`

Add the required inputs to your flake configuration:

```nix
{
  description = "NixOS configuration with Noctalia";
  
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    
    quickshell = {
      url = "github:outfoxxed/quickshell";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    
    noctalia = {
      url = "github:noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      inputs.quickshell.follows = "quickshell";
    };
  };
  
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, noctalia, quickshell, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

**Step 2**: Add packages to `configuration.nix`

Include Noctalia and Quickshell in your system packages:

```nix
{ config, pkgs, inputs, ... }:

{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    inputs.noctalia.packages.${system}.default
    inputs.quickshell.packages.${system}.default
  ];
}
```

**Step 3**: Rebuild your system

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

:::note
NixOS installation requires nixpkgs unstable for compatibility with the latest Quickshell and Noctalia features.
:::

## Running Noctalia

After installation, start Noctalia with:

```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell
```

:::tip[Installation-specific commands]
- **NixOS Flake users**: Use `noctalia-shell` directly instead of `qs -c noctalia-shell`
- **Manual installation users**: If you have Noctalia in `~/.config/quickshell/`, you can use `qs` to start Noctalia. For keybinds you'd use `qs ipc ...` instead.
