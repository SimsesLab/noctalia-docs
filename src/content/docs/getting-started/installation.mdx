## Overview

Installing Noctalia is straightforward and depends on your Linux distribution.  
Choose your installation method:

**Arch Linux:**
1. [AUR Installation (Recommended)](#using-aur-recommended) - Automatic dependency handling
2. [Development Version](#development-version) - Latest features from Git

**NixOS:**
1. [Quick Run](#quick-run) - Test without installing
2. [Permanent Installation](#permanent-installation) - Add to system configuration

**Any Distribution:**
1. [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) - Full control over the process

**Compositor Settings:**
1. [Niri](#niri) - Recommended settings to add to your config

After installation, you'll [run Noctalia](#running-noctalia) and set up [keybinds](./keybinds) for the best experience.

## Arch Linux

### Using AUR (Recommended)
The simplest way to install Noctalia on Arch Linux is through the Arch User Repository (AUR). This method installs the shell system-wide and handles dependencies automatically.

Please replace with your AUR helper of choice.
```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell
```

### Development Version
For the latest features and fixes, you can install the development version directly from the Git repository:
```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell-git
```

:::caution
The development version may be less stable than the official release. Use this version if you want to test the latest features or contribute to development.
:::

## NixOS

### Quick Run
Test Noctalia without installing by running it directly:
```bash
nix run github:noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell
```

### Permanent Installation
For a permanent installation on NixOS, you'll need to add Noctalia to your system configuration.

**Step 1**: Update your `flake.nix`
Add the required inputs to your flake configuration:
```nix
{
  description = "NixOS configuration with Noctalia";
  
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    
    quickshell = {
      url = "github:outfoxxed/quickshell";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    
    noctalia = {
      url = "github:noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      inputs.quickshell.follows = "quickshell";
    };
  };
  
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, noctalia, quickshell, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

**Step 2**: Add packages to `configuration.nix`
Include Noctalia and Quickshell in your system packages:
```nix
{ config, pkgs, inputs, ... }:
{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    inputs.noctalia.packages.${system}.default
    inputs.quickshell.packages.${system}.default
  ];
}
```

**Step 3**: Rebuild your system
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

:::note
NixOS installation requires nixpkgs unstable for compatibility with the latest Quickshell and Noctalia features. Dependencies are handled automatically by the Nix package manager.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install Noctalia locally or want more control over the installation process, you can install it manually to your user configuration directory. This method works on any Linux distribution.

**Step 1**: Install required dependencies

For Arch Linux:
```bash
# Core dependencies (required)
paru -S quickshell-git ttf-roboto inter-font gpu-screen-recorder brightnessctl

# Desktop monitor brightness (may cause instability with some monitors)
paru -S ddcutil

# Optional dependencies
paru -S cliphist matugen cava wlsunset xdg-desktop-portal
```

For other distributions, install the equivalent packages using your package manager.

**Step 2**: Download and install Noctalia
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell && \
curl -sL https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/releases/latest/download/noctalia-latest.tar.gz | \
tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell
```

### Dependencies Explained

**Required:**
- `quickshell-git` - Core shell framework
- `ttf-roboto` - Default UI font
- `inter-font` - Headers font (clock on LockScreen, etc.)
- `gpu-screen-recorder` - Screen recording functionality
- `brightnessctl` - Internal/laptop monitor brightness control

**Hardware-specific:**
- `ddcutil` - Desktop monitor brightness control (⚠️ may introduce system instability with certain monitors)

**Optional but recommended:**
- `cliphist` - Clipboard history support
- `matugen` - Material You color scheme generation
- `cava` - Audio visualizer component
- `wlsunset` - Night light functionality
- `xdg-desktop-portal` - Enables "Portal" option in screen recorder

:::tip
Manual installation keeps Noctalia contained within your user directory, making it easy to remove or update without affecting system packages.

## Compositor Settings

For the best experience with Noctalia, you'll need to configure your compositor with some specific settings.

### Niri

Add these settings to your Niri configuration file (usually `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`):

```kdl
debug {
    honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial
}

window-rule {
    geometry-corner-radius 20
    clip-to-geometry true
}

layer-rule {
    match namespace="^quickshell-overview$"
    place-within-backdrop true
}
```

These settings ensure:
- Proper window activation handling
- Rounded corners for a modern look
- Correct backdrop placement for the overview panel
- Allows Notification actions (`honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial`)

:::note
The configuration files are saved in `~/.config/noctalia/` and the cache files are saved in `~/.cache/noctalia/`.
