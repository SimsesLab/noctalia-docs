After installation, start Noctalia with:
```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell
```

:::tip[Installation-specific commands]
- **NixOS Flake users**: Use `noctalia-shell` directly instead of `qs -c noctalia-shell`
- **Manual installation users**: If you have Noctalia in `~/.config/quickshell/`, you can use `qs` to start Noctalia. For keybinds you'd use `qs ipc ...` instead.
