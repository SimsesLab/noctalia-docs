### Standard Launch
The most direct way to start Noctalia is by invoking it through Quickshell. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell
```

:::tip[Manual installation users]
- **Manual installation users**: If you have Noctalia in `~/.config/quickshell/`, you can use `qs` to start Noctalia. For keybinds you'd use `qs ipc ...` instead.

### For NixOS Users
If you installed Noctalia using the NixOS Flake, a simpler, direct command is available:
```bash
noctalia-shell
```

### Running as a Systemd Service (Advanced)
For more robust control, you can run Noctalia as a systemd user service. This automatically handles restarts on failure and centralizes logging with journalctl

#### 1. Create the service file
First, create a new service definition file at `~/.config/systemd/user/noctalia.service` with the following content:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Noctalia Shell Service
PartOf=graphical-session.target
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=qs -c noctalia-shell
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

#### 2. Enable and Start the Service

Next, enable the service to have it start automatically with your graphical session.

If you use a compositor like Niri, it's best to tie Noctalia directly to it. This ensures they start and stop together.

```bash
# Example for Niri users
systemctl --user add-wants niri.service noctalia.service
```

Alternatively, you can enable it more generally with:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now noctalia.service
```
