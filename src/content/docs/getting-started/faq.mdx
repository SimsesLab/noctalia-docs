## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I run Noctalia on distributions other than Arch and NixOS?</strong></summary>

Most distributions offer `quickshell` or `quickshell-git`. If you can install either, you can use Noctalia. If your distro doesn’t provide Quickshell, you can build it from source.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are some of my app icons missing?</strong></summary>

The issue is most likely that environment variables are not set properly.
Use one of the following:

If you already have an icon theme set for GTK then you can use this one:
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk3`

You can also use Qt6ct to set your icon theme; for that you can use:
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct`

If you don't have either of those set then you can set:
- `QS_ICON_THEME="youricontheme"`

**Add these variables to `/etc/environment` and reboot. On NixOS, use `environment.variables` or `home.sessionVariables`.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Why wont unoccupied workspaces show up in Hyprland?</strong></summary>

Set workspaces as persistent in your Hyprland config. See [Hyprland Workspace Rules](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/#rules) for details.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why aren't my keybinds working?</strong></summary>

Common causes:

1. **Wrong command syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct IPC command format
2. **Window manager configuration**: Verify your keybind syntax matches your WM (Hyprland vs Niri)
3. **Noctalia not running**: Keybinds only work when Noctalia is running

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What window managers does Noctalia support?</strong></summary>

Noctalia is designed for and tested with Hyprland and Niri. While it may work with other compositors, we currently only support workspace indicators for Niri and Hyprland.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why wont some applications appear in the launcher?</strong></summary>

The launcher looks for `.desktop` files in standard locations. If an application doesn’t appear:

1. **Refresh the launcher cache** by restarting Noctalia.
2. **Verify that a `.desktop` file exists** in one of these directories:
   - `/usr/share/applications/`
   - `~/.local/share/applications/`
   - `$HOME/.nix-profile/share/applications/` (apps installed with Nix/Home Manager)
   - `/etc/profiles/per-user/$USER/share/applications/` (system/user-wide Nix profiles)
3. **Create a `.desktop` file manually** for custom applications if none is provided.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does Noctalia crash on startup?</strong></summary>

1. **Check the error output** by running Noctalia from the terminal
2. **Update dependencies** - outdated Quickshell versions can cause issues
3. **Check system logs** for additional error information

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does the shell look different than expected?</strong></summary>

1. **Check your theme settings** in the settings panel
2. **Verify your display settings** - scaling and resolution can affect appearance
3. **Update to the latest version** - UI improvements are frequently released

</details>
