Find answers to common questions about Noctalia installation, configuration, and usage.

## Installation & Setup

### Can I run Noctalia on other distributions besides Arch and NixOS?

Currently, Noctalia currently only supports Arch Linux and NixOS. While it may work on other distributions, you might have to find the proper package names and/or compile specific things.

## Configuration & Customization

### How do I change the theme or appearance?

Noctalia's appearance can be customized through the settings panel. Access it with:
```bash
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call settings toggle
```
Please do remember that the IPC call depends on the way you installed Noctralia, see [Keybinds](./keybinds).

### Some of my app icons are missing!

The issue is most likely that you did not set up your environment variables properly.
Example environment variables that you can use one of the following:

If you already have an icon theme set for GTK then you can use this one:
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk3`

You can also use Qt6ct to set your icon theme, for that you can use:
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct`

If you don't have either of those set then you can just use:
- `QS_ICON_THEME="youricontheme"`

**Any of these environment variables should go into `/etc/environment` (you need to reboot afterwards). For NixOS you can use `environment.variables` or `home.sessionVariables`.**


### My keybinds aren't working. What's wrong?

Common keybind issues:

1. **Wrong command syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct IPC command format
2. **Window manager configuration**: Verify your keybind syntax matches your WM (Hyprland vs Niri)
3. **Noctalia not running**: Keybinds only work when Noctalia is running

### Can I use Noctalia with other window managers besides Hyprland and Niri?

Noctalia is specifically designed for and tested with Hyprland and Niri. While Noctalia works with other compositors we currently only support workspace indicators for niri & hyprland.

### Some applications don't appear in the launcher

The application launcher looks for `.desktop` files in standard locations.  
If an application doesn’t appear:

1. **Refresh the launcher cache** by restarting Noctalia.  
2. **Verify that a `.desktop` file exists** in one of these directories:
   - `/usr/share/applications/`
   - `~/.local/share/applications/`
   - `$HOME/.nix-profile/share/applications/` (apps installed with Nix/Home Manager)
   - `/etc/profiles/per-user/$USER/share/applications/` (system/user-wide Nix profiles)
3. **Create a `.desktop` file manually** for custom applications if none is provided.


### Audio/brightness controls aren't working

Media key functionality depends on your system setup:

- **Audio**: Requires PipeWire or PulseAudio to be running
- **Brightness**: Needs proper permissions for brightness control (usually handled automatically)

Check if the commands work manually:
```bash
# Test audio
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call volume increase

# Test brightness
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call brightness increase
```

## Troubleshooting

### Noctalia crashes on startup

1. **Check the error output** by running Noctalia from the terminal
2. **Update dependencies** - outdated Quickshell versions can cause issues
3. **Check system logs** for additional error information

### The shell looks different than expected

1. **Check your theme settings** in the settings panel
2. **Verify your display settings** - scaling and resolution can affect appearance
3. **Update to the latest version** - UI improvements are frequently released

### Development Guidelines

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns.
2. Keep features modular - place new work under `Modules/`, `Services/`, or `Widgets/` as appropriate.
3. Implement robust error handling and logging.
4. Test changes with both Hyprland and Niri compositors where applicable.
5. Prefer small, focused PRs and include tests when possible.
