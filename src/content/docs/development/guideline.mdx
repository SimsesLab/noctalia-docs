### Development Guidelines

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns.
2. Keep features modular - place new work under `Modules/`, `Services/`, or `Widgets/` as appropriate.
3. Implement robust error handling and logging.
4. Test changes with both Hyprland and Niri compositors where applicable.
5. Prefer small, focused PRs and include tests when possible.

Don’t worry about perfection - open an issue or start a discussion to iterate on ideas before or during implementation.
